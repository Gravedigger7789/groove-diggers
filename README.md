`Groove Diggers` was created for the [2023 GitHub Game-Off](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2023)

**GitHub Game-Off Theme: SCALE**

- To remove tartar, plaque, or gold from teeth.

---

## Backstory

You happen across a sleeping giant, a race notorious for using the purest of gold to fill their teeth. Many have died trying to recover the precious metal, but you have a secret weapon- rhythm! Groove to the beat of the beast's snores while you plunder his fillings, and make it out with enough gold to buy a round of pints for the homies.

## Object of the Game

- Mine as much gold from the giant's teeth as possible by hitting the notes with precision timing!
- When mining the gold, line up the center of the pickaxe with the center of the gold for the most points.
- Missing a note will cause you to spill some of your beer, be careful not to run out!
